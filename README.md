**Assignment 1, Matchismo**<br />
This assignment extends the card matching game Matchismo (Pairs/ Concentration) to get experience understanding MVC, modifying an MVC’s View in Xcode, creating actions and outlets, interacting with UILabel, UIButton and other iOS 6 SDK elements, and generally getting more experience with Xcode and Objective-C.

**Assignment 2, Set**<br />
In this assignment, the solution from Assignment 1 is extended to add a second card game, Set, to the card matching game.  The games are separated using a tab bar controller and the game's output is presented to the user using instances of NSAttributedString.
